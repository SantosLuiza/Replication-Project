##Introduction

As a graduate student in Psychology, I am interested in exploring the processes underlying moral cognition. One particular area of interest is to examine how people perceive different types of moral transgressions. Related to this topic, Jordan and colleagues (2017) sought to explain why hypocrites (i.e., those who condemn transgressions they engage in) are more disliked than individuals who commit the same transgressions without condemning them. The authors hypothesized that hypocrites are disliked because their condemnation falsely signals their own moral goodness. Although all five studies reported in this paper support this prediction in different ways, Study 4 is the only one that explicitly focuses on the false-signaling element and is, therefore, critical to the article's key claim. Thus, Study 4's results will be the target of this replication. 

As the authors made all data and materials publicly available via the Open Science Framework, potential replication difficulties have been significantly decreased.

##Methods

###Planned Sample

In the original paper, Jordan and colleagues recruited 457 subjects online using Amazon Mturk. For this replication project, we will run the study's original sample size (approximately 150 participants per condition) with two conditions, for a total of 300 participants. As the control condition isn't crucial for the study's central claim, we will drop it from this replication.

We will analyze responses from all subjects who have unique IP addresses and have evaluated all the vignettes.

###Materials

We will use the same materials employed by original authors. All the experimental materials for this study are available online and can be accessed here: https://osf.io/2r8ab/.

Each participant will be presented with four vignettes (in random order), about downloading music illegally, evading jury duty, ignoring phone calls from one's mother, and wasting paper by printing documents single-sided. 

In each vignette, a target character discusses an acquaintance's moral transgression and then privately goes on to engage in the same transgression. In a two-condition, between-subjects design, we will manipulate whether, before engaging in the relevant moral transgression, the target (a) condemned the violation (traditional-hypocrite condition), or (b) condemned the violation but explicitly negated any signaling value of the condemnation (honest-hypocrite condition).

After reading the vignettes, participants will be asked to evaluate the target.

###Procedure	

We will follow the original paper's procedure precisely. Below is a detailed description of the study design as outlined by original authors.

"Each vignette described a conversation between two characters: a target (whom subjects would later evaluate) and a friend (whom subjects would not evaluate). In all conditions, this conversation began with the target and the friend discussing a mutual acquaintance. In this discussion, the friend mentioned that the mutual acquaintance often engaged in a particular moral transgression."

"In the traditional-hypocrite condition, the target responded to the friend by condemning the transgression. In the honest-hypocrite condition, the target responded to the friend by stating that he or she believed the behavior in question to be morally wrong but sometimes behaved that way anyway. (...) Shortly after this conversation ended, in all conditions, the target went on to commit the relevant violation.

For example, here is the full text for a scenario about downloading music illegally. In this scenario, Becky is the target character, and Amanda is the friend. In all conditions, the vignette began as follows:

    Becky and her friend Amanda are discussing a mutual acquaintance. Amanda mentions that the acquaintance often downloads music illegally from the Internet.

In the traditional-hypocrite condition, the scenario continued with

    Becky says that she thinks it is morally wrong to download music illegally from the Internet. Shortly after their conversation, Becky goes online, and downloads music illegally.

In the honest-hypocrite condition, the passage instead continued with

    Becky says that she thinks it is morally wrong to download music illegally from the Internet, but that she sometimes does it anyway. Shortly after their conversation, Becky goes online, and downloads music illegally.

After reading each vignette, subjects evaluated the target. We asked subjects to rate how good a person the target was, how much they liked the target, how honest they thought the target was, and how trustworthy they thought the target was. These five dependent measures were presented in random order for each vignette. They responded to each item on a sliding scale, with anchors reading not at all [trait] to very [trait] (e.g., not at all trustworthy to very trustworthy). The sliding scales did not have any numerical labels, but responses were translated to scores ranging from 0 (not at all) to 100 (very)."

###Analysis Plan

To test the authors' prediction, we will conduct a pairwise comparison investigating the effect of condition on positive evaluations of the targets across the vignettes.

In order to confirm that the honest hypocrite manipulation fully eliminates disapproval of hypocrisy, pairwise comparisons should reveal that traditional hypocrites are evaluated more negatively than honest hypocrites. 

Following the original article criteria, we will exclude from the analysis participants who have identical IP addresses and those who do not complete the survey.

###Differences from Original Study

The only antecipated difference from the original study is that, in this replication, we won't be running the control condition.

``` 

#### Actual Sample
  As anticipated, we collected data from 300 Mturkers (54% male). All participants had unique IP addresses and completed the survey, therefore there were no exclusions. 

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  No differences from what was described as the original plan. 

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

This project's results show a successful replication of Study 4 of Jordan 2017. Similarly to the original study, we found high interitem reliability among the four evaluation variables (?? = .94), and we averaged these ratings to create a composite scale. 

The original paper's primary statistical analysis was replicated as traditional hypocrites (M = 35.45, SD = 19.04) were judged more negatively than honest hypocrites (M = 51.97, SD = 17.23), mean difference = 16.52, 95% CI = [12.39, 20.65], t(296) = 7.88, p < .001, d = 0.91. 

Moreover, exploratory pairwise comparisons showed that, just like the original study, traditional hypocrites (M
= 79.74, SD = 18.95) were seen as more hypocritical than honest hypocrites (M = 62.39, SD =20.31), (t(292) = -7.62, p < .001, d = .88).

### Commentary

Overall, Jordan 2017 Study 4's results were successfully replicated. All results were faithful to the ones reported in the original paper.
